.. warning::

    These docs are for Thot versions 0.9.x and below.

    For the versions 0.10.0 and above, please visit `our new tutorials <https://github.com/thot-data/tutorials>`_.

These tutorials will get you started using Thot to manage and analyze your data. They use hands on examples to show you how to do things and demonstrate the concepts Thot is built on.

To perform our analysis we’ll use Thot. Thot offers three interfaces: the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, **Thot Desktop**, and **Thot Web**. The CLI and Thot Desktop are both run from your own computer, while Thot Web runs on Thot’s servers and provides additional functionality.

	<h2>CLI</h2>

The command line interface is a text based interface that uses command prompt if you're on Windows, or terminal if you're on Mac or UNIX. 

Using the CLI is a bit harder to get a grasp of than the Desktop and Web versions, but is also more powerful.

* :fa:`desktop` Runs on your own computer
* :fa:`code` Powerful operations for bulk editing
