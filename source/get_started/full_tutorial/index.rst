    These docs are for Thot versions 0.9.x and below.
    For the versions 0.10.0 and above, please visit `our new tutorials <https://github.com/thot-data/tutorials>`_.

This tutorial will walk you through the full functionality of Thot. You'll recreate the same Firworks example as in the Quick Start chapter, but this time dive into more of the details. You'll learn different ways to use Thot Desktop and/or CLI, and how to write your own scripts.
